### Linked List Overview
- **Definition:** A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- **Types of Linked Lists:**
  - **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
  - **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

### Node Structure
- **Components of a Node:**
  - **Data:** The value stored in the node.
  - **Next Pointer:** A reference to the next node in the list (in doubly linked lists, also a previous pointer).

### Basic Operations
1. **Traversal:**
   - Start from the head node and follow the next pointers until reaching the end of the list.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

2. **Insertion:**
   - **At the beginning:** Create a new node, set its next pointer to the current head, and update the head to the new node.
   - **At the end:** Traverse to the last node and set its next pointer to the new node.
   - **At a specific position:** Traverse to the node just before the desired position and adjust the pointers accordingly.
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for beginning, O(n) for end or specific position.

3. **Deletion:**
   - **From the beginning:** Update the head to the next node.
   - **From the end:** Traverse to the second last node and set its next pointer to null.
   - **From a specific position:** Traverse to the node just before the desired position and adjust the pointers accordingly.
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for beginning, O(n) for end or specific position.

4. **Search:**
   - Traverse the list, comparing each node's data with the target value.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

### Advantages of Linked Lists
- **Dynamic Size:** Can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Insertions and deletions are more efficient compared to arrays, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Disadvantages of Linked Lists
- **Memory Usage:** Requires extra memory for storing pointers.
- **Sequential Access:** Slower access time compared to arrays, as elements cannot be indexed directly.

### Common Problems and Solutions
1. **Reversing a Linked List:**
   - Iterative approach: Use three pointers (previous, current, next) to reverse the direction of the list.
   - Recursive approach: Recursively reverse the list and adjust pointers.

2. **Detecting a Cycle:**
   - **Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare):** Use two pointers (slow and fast) to detect if the list contains a cycle.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

3. **Finding the Middle Element:**
   - Use two pointers (slow and fast). Move slow by one step and fast by two steps. When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

### Example Code Snippets

**Node Class Definition:**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

**Singly Linked List Implementation:**
```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node

    def delete_node(self, key):
        temp = self.head
        if temp and temp.data == key:
            self.head = temp.next
            temp = None
            return
        prev = None
        while temp and temp.data != key:
            prev = temp
            temp = temp.next
        if not temp:
            return
        prev.next = temp.next
        temp = None

    def search(self, key):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == key:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=' ')
            current = current.next
        print()
```
