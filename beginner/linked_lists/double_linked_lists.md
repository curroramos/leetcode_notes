### Doubly Linked List Overview
A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains two pointers:
1. **Next Pointer:** Points to the next node in the sequence.
2. **Previous Pointer:** Points to the previous node in the sequence.

### Node Structure
- **Components of a Node:**
  - **Data:** The value stored in the node.
  - **Next Pointer:** A reference to the next node in the list.
  - **Previous Pointer:** A reference to the previous node in the list.

### Basic Operations
1. **Traversal:**
   - **Forward Traversal:** Start from the head node and follow the next pointers until reaching the end of the list.
   - **Backward Traversal:** Start from the tail node and follow the previous pointers until reaching the beginning of the list.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

2. **Insertion:**
   - **At the beginning:** Create a new node, set its next pointer to the current head, and set the previous pointer of the current head to the new node. Update the head to the new node.
   - **At the end:** Create a new node, set its previous pointer to the current tail, and set the next pointer of the current tail to the new node. Update the tail to the new node.
   - **At a specific position:** Traverse to the node just before the desired position, create a new node, adjust the next and previous pointers of the surrounding nodes.
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for beginning, O(n) for end or specific position.

3. **Deletion:**
   - **From the beginning:** Update the head to the next node and set the previous pointer of the new head to null.
   - **From the end:** Update the tail to the previous node and set the next pointer of the new tail to null.
   - **From a specific position:** Traverse to the node just before the desired position, adjust the next and previous pointers of the surrounding nodes to exclude the node to be deleted.
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for beginning, O(n) for end or specific position.

4. **Search:**
   - Traverse the list, comparing each node's data with the target value.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

### Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists
- **Bidirectional Traversal:** Can traverse in both forward and backward directions.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Insertions and deletions are more efficient compared to singly linked lists, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Disadvantages of Doubly Linked Lists
- **Memory Usage:** Requires extra memory for storing two pointers (next and previous) in each node.
- **Complexity:** More complex to implement compared to singly linked lists due to the additional pointers.

### Common Problems and Solutions
1. **Reversing a Doubly Linked List:**
   - Swap the next and previous pointers for all nodes.
   - Update the head to the last node in the original list.

2. **Finding the Middle Element:**
   - Use two pointers (slow and fast). Move slow by one step and fast by two steps. When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

### Example Code Snippets

**Node Class Definition:**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
```

**Doubly Linked List Implementation:**
```python
class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head.prev = new_node
            self.head = new_node

    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.tail:
            self.head = self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.prev = self.tail
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

    def delete_node(self, key):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == key:
                if current.prev:
                    current.prev.next = current.next
                if current.next:
                    current.next.prev = current.prev
                if current == self.head:
                    self.head = current.next
                if current == self.tail:
                    self.tail = current.prev
                return
            current = current.next

    def search(self, key):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == key:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

    def print_list_forward(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=' ')
            current = current.next
        print()

    def print_list_backward(self):
        current = self.tail
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=' ')
            current = current.prev
        print()
```
