### Two Pointers Technique Overview

The two pointers technique is an algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or lists, where two pointers (or indices) are used to iterate through the data structure from different directions. This technique is particularly useful for problems involving searching, sorting, or partitioning elements and helps reduce the time complexity of the solution.

### Key Concepts

1. **Two Pointers:** Typically, one pointer starts at the beginning and the other at the end of the array or list.
2. **Converging Pointers:** The pointers move towards each other based on certain conditions until they meet or cross.
3. **Diverging Pointers:** The pointers can also start together and move in different directions.

### Example Problems and Solutions

1. **Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted**

   - **Problem:** Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed).
   - **Approach:** Use two pointers to find the two numbers that add up to the target.

**Example Code:**
```python
def two_sum_sorted(numbers, target):
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1

    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return []

# Example usage
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum_sorted(numbers, target))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

2. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

   - **Problem:** Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
   - **Approach:** Use two pointers to track unique elements and overwrite duplicates.

**Example Code:**
```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    write_index = 1

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
            nums[write_index] = nums[i]
            write_index += 1

    return write_index

# Example usage
nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
new_length = remove_duplicates(nums)
print(new_length)  # Output: 5
print(nums[:new_length])  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

3. **Container With Most Water**

   - **Problem:** Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an`, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
   - **Approach:** Use two pointers to calculate the maximum area while moving the pointers inward.

**Example Code:**
```python
def max_area(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_water = 0

    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        max_water = max(max_water, min(height[left], height[right]) * width)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return max_water

# Example usage
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
print(max_area(height))  # Output: 49
```

4. **Valid Palindrome**

   - **Problem:** Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
   - **Approach:** Use two pointers to compare characters from both ends of the string.

**Example Code:**
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return True

# Example usage
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
print(is_palindrome(s))  # Output: True
```

5. **Three Sum**

   - **Problem:** Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
   - **Approach:** Sort the array and use two pointers to find pairs that sum up to the negative of the current element.

**Example Code:**
```python
def three_sum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return result

# Example usage
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
print(three_sum(nums))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```
